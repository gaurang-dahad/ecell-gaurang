            <p style="font-size:36px;">Hey! My name is Gaurang Dahad.</p>
            <p>I am 18 years old and will be turning 19 this month (provided you're reading this in May 2022). I am from Sangamner, Maharashtra. Currently, I am studying in my first year at IIT Hyderabad and pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering.</p>
            <p>If you're reading this and thinking that 'Oh! This guy is from EE branch, he must be really good at those topics'; let me just tell you that you could not have been more wrong. But I won't delve into this topic even further as this is not an essay about my excellent skills to make terrible decisions.</p>
            <p>Although I would take a moment to address how messed up the Indian Education System is. I mean, I just worked immensely hard to get into a good college and now I have to work even harder. What kind of messed up scam is that?</p>
            <p>On the topic of Web Development, I am mostly self-taught. However, I'd like to assure you that I'll work extremely hard to contribute to the domain in all ways that I can. I am incredibly eager to learn and improve my skills.</p>

            <div class="blank" id="fun-facts"></div>
            <p>Here are a few fun facts about me:</p>
            <ul class="facts-list">
                <li>I have the most obvious/cliche favourite singer in the world - Arijit Singh.</li>
                <li>I used to play guitar. I still do, but I used to too.</li>
                <li>I support Mumbai Indians in the IPL.</li>
                <li>I am the eldest among my first cousins.</li>
                <li>I can speak Hindi, English, Marathi and Marwadi fluently and know enough Gujarati to be able to maintain a conversation.</li>
                <li>Although, I learnt Spanish in school, I don't know more than 10 words in it and I still got good grades, which should also tell you about the uselessness of our education system.</li>
                <li>Unpopular opinion that I have: I don't like pasta.</li>
                <li>I am not really a foodie. I don't have the same appreciation for good food as others do. This actually helped me in adjusting to the mess food at IITH.</li>
                <li>I am an avid reader but I have to stop myself from starting new books sometimes because I have little self control. I either read books in 2 days or 2 months. Nothing in between.</li>
